# Recommendation-for-Restaurants-in-Tampa-Florida
Here we are using a recommendation system to predict good restaurants according to a person's liking in Florida.

In Pre-processing we have merged the two important datasets that are the business and review datasets. 
As the data is really big and due to computational limitations we have decided to work with only a limited set of features that are needed for our recommendation system.
In this Project, we are going cover the state of Florida as it is seen to be one of the most robust datasets.
